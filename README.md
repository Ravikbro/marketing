# RandomForestClassifier
## Overview
RandomForestClassifier is an ensemble learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Ensemble learning combines the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make more accurate predictions than any individual model. In the case of RandomForestClassifier, it builds a forest of decision trees and merges their predictions to achieve robust and accurate classification.

# How it Works
## 1. Bootstrapped Sampling:

- Random subsets of the training data are created through bootstrapped sampling (sampling with replacement).


## 2. Decision Tree Construction:
- A decision tree is constructed for each subset of data.
- At each node of the tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting.

## 3. Voting Mechanism:
- During prediction, each tree "votes" for a class.
- The class with the majority of votes is the final predicted class.

## 4. Reduced Overfitting:
- The randomness introduced in both data sampling and feature selection helps reduce overfitting.
## 5. Parallelization:
- Training of individual trees can be parallelized, making it efficient for large datasets.

# Key Parameters
- ##  n_estimators:

- The number of trees in the forest.

- ## criterion:
- The function used to measure the quality of a split.

- ## max_depth:
- The maximum depth of the tree.

- ## min_samples_split:

- The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
min_samples_leaf:

The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
